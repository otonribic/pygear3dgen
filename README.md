# pygear3dgen
A pure Python library that generates various types of gears according to parameters in a function, and exports it to ubiquitous Wavefront (.OBJ) file that can be used elsewhere.
Specify inner and outer radii, thickness, tooth shape function, rotation (shape), etc. and have a gear 3D file generated - as simple as that.
